# MASM_Project
* Written by Elaine Laguerta*  
*Project designed by Paul Paulson, Dr. Ramesh Rajagopalan, and Stephen Redfield, Oregon State University*

This was submitted as the final project for Computer Architecture and Assembly Language (CS271) at Oregon State University.
The program gets 10 signed integers from the user as keyboard input, converts the strings 
to numeric form, and stores the numeric values in an array. It displays the integers, and writes their sum and average to the console.
